# Setup TodoHub

clone the project using this url:

`https://github.com/Sbenitez73/todohub-api.git`

## Install and setup the project

The project is configured to just clone the repository and run the web api, but previosly you need some tools:

- `.NET 7`
- `Visual studio with IIS Express`

The database is up so, you don't need to configure databases or connections because inside of this project use Azure Keyvault so the definition of sentitive information is inside this Azure service.

Basically that's it.
